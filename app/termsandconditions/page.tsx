                       <br/><br/><span className='font-bold underline'> BILLING AND PAYMENT POLICY:</span>  Signing up as a user of the EXTRA platform is free of charge to both Businesses and Contractors. If a Business contracts the services of a Contractor, they will be charged the hourly fees charged by that contractors ('Service Fee') for his or her services as would have been stipulated prior to entering into such contract. These Service Fees are based on accepted industry standards for a specific service or a Service Fee that contractor specifies as wanting to charge at the time of signing up as a user on the platform. The Service Fees are not determined by EXTRA and both Business and Contractor enter into a relationship solely at their discretion. As a business, you agree that any amounts charged following the completion of a service by a Contractor are mandatory and due and payable immediately upon completion of the service or due based on terms that may be applicable and agreed to by you and EXTRA. Once you post a job on the platform and prior to our actual transmitting of that post to our eligible contractors you will be clearly communicated what the full charges for the service will be. Once you accept to confirm such posting this will be the Service Fee you accept to pay for the services. Accepting to contract a service at the specified fee is solely at your discretion. Once the service is completed the full charges including any applicable taxes are assessed immediately and are non-refundable. This no refund policy shall apply at all times regardless of your decision to terminate usage of the EXTRA Platform, any disruption to the Platform or Services, or any other reason whatsoever.  Once a job has been posted by a Business for a service that begins at a specific date and time, a Business can cancel such service request up to two hours prior to commencement of that service. If cancellation occurs at a time less than two hours to the commencement of the service the business will be charged a 25% Cancellation Fee payable as per the same terms described above for normal Service Fees.  As a Contractor, in exchange for providing the exchange platform as well as facilitating payments and permitting you to offer your Services through the EXTRA Platform and marketplace, you agree to pay EXTRA (and permit EXTRA to retain) a fee based on each transaction in which you provide Services (the 'Administrative Fee').  The amount of the applicable Administrative Fee will be communicated to you at the time you sign up as a user on the platform and specify the services that you will be offering. EXTRA reserves the right to change the Administrative Fee at any time in EXTRA's discretionbased upon local market factors, and EXTRA will provide you with notice in the event of such change.
                         Continued use of the EXTRA Platform after any such change in the Administrative Fee calculation shall constitute your consent to such change. <u>Facilitation of Payments:</u>  All credit and debit card charges are facilitated through a third-party payment processing service. EXTRA may replace its third-party payment processing service without notice to you. Charges shall only be made through the EXTRA platform. Cash or other payments directly to Contractors by Businesses are strictly prohibited. <u>Credit Card Authorization:</u> Upon addition of a new payment method or each service request, EXTRA may seek authorization of your selected payment method to verify your payment method, ensure the service cost will be covered, and protect against unauthorized behavior. The authorization is not a charge, however, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization amount until your bank's next processing cycle. Should the amount of our authorization exceed the total funds on deposit in your account, you may be subject to overdraft of NSF charges by the bank issuing your debit or check card. We cannot be held responsible for these charges and are unable to assist you in recovering them from your issuing bank. <u>Promotions:</u> EXTRA, at its sole discretion, may make available promotions with different features to any Contractors or Businesses.

Furthermore, you expressly waive any rights you may have under California Civil Code Section 1542 (or analogous laws of other states), which says: 'A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.'
